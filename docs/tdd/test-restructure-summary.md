# Test Restructure Summary

## New Feature-Based Structure

```
e2e/
├── setup/
│   └── global.setup.ts              # Technical setup for authentication
├── authentication/
│   ├── sign-in-flow.spec.ts        # Sign-in/out user journeys
│   └── protected-routes.spec.ts    # Authenticated access tests
└── [future features]/
    ├── expectations/                # To be added for expectations feature
    └── history/                     # To be added for history feature
```

## Business-Focused Test Descriptions

### Before (Technical Focus)
```
- "main tests > sign in"
- "authenticated tests > already signed in"
- "authenticated tests > can access protected routes"
```

### After (Business Focus)
```
User Sign-in Flow:
- "unauthenticated user is redirected to sign-in when accessing protected routes"
- "user can sign in with email and password"
- "user can sign out and loses access to protected content"

Protected Routes Access:
- "authenticated user can access dashboard"
- "authenticated user session persists across page refreshes"
- "authenticated user can navigate between protected routes"
```

## Test Organization Benefits

1. **Clear Business Context**: Test names describe actual user behaviors
2. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature has its own directory
3. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - `sign-in-flow.spec.ts` - Tests that start without authentication
   - `protected-routes.spec.ts` - Tests that use pre-saved authentication
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features (expectations, history, etc.)

## Playwright Configuration

The configuration now has three projects:
1. **setup** - Runs global authentication setup
2. **authentication** - Tests sign-in/out flows
3. **authenticated features** - Tests that require pre-authentication (uses saved session)

## Test Coverage

| Feature Area | Test File | Test Count | Description |
|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Authentication Setup | `setup/global.setup.ts` | 2 | Sets up testing token and saves session |
| Sign-in Flow | `authentication/sign-in-flow.spec.ts` | 3 | User authentication journeys |
| Protected Routes | `authentication/protected-routes.spec.ts` | 3 | Authenticated user access |
| **Total** | **3 files** | **8 tests** | Complete authentication coverage |

## Next Steps

When adding new features:
1. Create a new directory under `/e2e/` (e.g., `/e2e/expectations/`)
2. Add feature tests with business-focused descriptions
3. Update playwright config if special configuration needed
4. Tests requiring authentication should use the saved session state
