# Test Cleanup Summary

## What Was Removed

### Redundant Test Files (`/tests/e2e/`)
All 8 redundant test files were removed:
- `auth-basic.spec.ts` - Basic auth tests, redundant with current implementation
- `auth-clerk-official.spec.ts` - Early Clerk attempt
- `auth-clerk-proper.spec.ts` - Used old env variables
- `debug-signin.spec.ts` - Debug helper, no longer needed
- `ticket-2-authentication-clerk.spec.ts` - Old fixture-based approach
- `ticket-2-authentication-direct.spec.ts` - Old iteration
- `ticket-2-authentication-simple.spec.ts` - Old iteration  
- `ticket-2-authentication.spec.ts` - Mock-based anti-pattern

### Mock Infrastructure (`/tests/`)
Removed all mock-based testing infrastructure:
- `/tests/fixtures/` - Old test fixtures
- `/tests/shared/` - Mock helpers and MSW handlers
- `/tests/mocks/` - Mock handlers
- `global-setup.ts` - Old global setup
- `setup.ts` - Old setup file

## What Was Kept

### Active E2E Tests (`/e2e/`)
The official Clerk testing implementation:
- `global.setup.ts` - Authentication and session setup
- `app.spec.ts` - Main auth flow tests
- `authenticated.spec.ts` - Protected route tests

### Test Structure Directories (`/tests/`)
Empty directories for future tests:
- `/tests/unit/` - For unit tests
- `/tests/integration/` - For integration tests
- `/tests/api/` - For API tests
- `/tests/helpers/` - For test utilities

## Why This Cleanup

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One implementation following Clerk's official pattern
2. **No Redundancy**: Removed 8 duplicate test files covering same functionality
3. **No Anti-patterns**: Removed all TEST_MODE and mock-based approaches
4. **Clear Structure**: Active tests in `/e2e/`, future tests organized in `/tests/`
5. **Security**: Removed all hardcoded passwords, now using environment variables

## Current Test Coverage

| Feature | Test File | Test Count |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Authentication setup | `global.setup.ts` | 2 tests |
| Sign-in flow | `app.spec.ts` | 3 tests |
| Protected routes | `authenticated.spec.ts` | 2 tests |
| **Total** | **3 files** | **7 tests** |

All tests pass with the official Clerk testing approach.
