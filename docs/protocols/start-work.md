Greetings AI agent!

# The goal of this protocol
This document is explaining to you (the AI agent) the protocol for `STARTING a new coding session.`.

# Starting point
- Remember who you are @docs/agents/dev.md ;
- Remember to use for this project backend repo navigation this starting point @docs/entrypoint.md ;
- The @docs/entrypoint.md document is a sacred source of knowledge. Use it to optimize your project navigation. Always first check the documentation and only then try to search using your own technics with current session context and documented information. Our goal is to optimize the used tokens by not reading irrelevant files.
- For current session create a new file `./agent-sessions/<serssion-name-here>-yyyy-mm-dd/plan-details.md` ;
- To track your progress create a new file `./agent-sessions/<serssion-name-here>-yyyy-mm-dd/agent-diary.md` ;

Wait for the next steps from human.
