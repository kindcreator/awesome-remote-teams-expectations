# Must Have Rules

## Core Development Rules

### Rule 1: Diagram Visualization Standard

For all diagrams and visualizations, always use Mermaid diagrams. This ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability across all project documentation.

### Rule 2: Mermaid Diagram Description Requirement

Each Mermaid diagram must include a description section that explains what is happening in the diagram. This text-based description serves as a fallback in case the Mermaid diagram is no longer available or cannot be rendered.
