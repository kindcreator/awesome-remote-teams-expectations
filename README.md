## What is this?

In remote teams, it's hard to know what everyone is working on. This app solves that with a dead-simple approach:
- Each person sets ONE current expectation
- Shows what they're doing and when they'll finish
- Everyone sees the team's focus at a glance
- Track history of completed work

## POC Status

This is a **Proof of Concept** following the 80/20 rule. Like an artist sketching basic shapes before adding details, this MVP demonstrates the core concept before implementing full features.

**Current state**: Basic UI and mock data only  
**Next steps**: Implement authentication, persistence, and real-time updates based on client feedback

## Development Approach

Following lean startup principles:
1. Build minimal viable version
2. Deploy and get real feedback
3. Shape implementation to actual needs
4. Avoid over-engineering

This approach ensures we build what teams actually need, not what we think they need.
