# Remote Teams Expectations Platform

A collaborative platform designed to enhance transparency and accountability in remote teams by allowing team members to set, track, and share their work expectations.

## Business Overview

Remote Teams Expectations addresses the fundamental challenge of visibility in distributed teams. Team members can communicate what they're working on, when they expect to complete it, and track their actual delivery against estimates.

## Key Features

### Real-time Team Visibility
See what every team member is currently focused on in a single dashboard view, eliminating the need for constant status update meetings.

### Expectation Management
Set clear expectations with estimated completion times, helping teams coordinate efforts and manage dependencies effectively.

### Performance Insights
Track completion history to identify patterns, improve estimation accuracy, and celebrate team accomplishments.

### Simple and Focused
One expectation per person at a time ensures clarity of focus and prevents overwhelming task lists.
