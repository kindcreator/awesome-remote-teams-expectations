# TDD Coverage Improvements Session - 2025-08-08

## Objective
Improve Test-Driven Development (TDD) coverage for Ticket #3: Expectations List by enhancing unit tests for the ExpectationsService.

## Current State Analysis
The code review revealed:
1. **API Tests**: Good coverage at integration level
2. **E2E Tests**: Complete UI validation 
3. **Unit Tests**: Basic smoke tests only - missing business logic validation

## Gap Identified
The `ExpectationsService` unit tests lack:
- Filtering logic validation (active expectations only)
- Sorting logic validation (by estimatedCompletion)
- Parameter handling tests (includeCompleted flag)

## Implementation Plan
1. Enhance unit tests for `ExpectationsService` methods:
   - `getAllActive()`: Test filtering and sorting
   - `getAll()`: Test parameter handling and sorting
   - `getByUserId()`: Test user-specific filtering
   - `getById()`: Test single expectation retrieval

2. Use proper mocking of database layer to isolate service logic

3. Follow TDD approach:
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement minimal code to pass
   - Refactor if needed

## Success Criteria
- All service methods have comprehensive unit tests
- Tests validate business logic in isolation
- Database mocking properly implemented
- Tests pass and provide confidence in service layer
