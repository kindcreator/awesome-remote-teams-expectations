# WSL Environment Fix Session - Agent Diary

## Session Start: 2025-01-05

### Initial Problem
User reported `make test-tdd` failing in WSL with Playwright browser dependency errors, despite ngrok working correctly.

### Actions Taken

1. **Created WSL-specific Playwright setup script** (`/scripts/setup-playwright-wsl.sh`)
   - Handles system dependency installation
   - Includes error handling for apt lock issues

2. **Updated Makefile**
   - Added `playwright-setup-wsl` command
   - Updated help documentation

3. **Updated documentation**
   - Added WSL-specific instructions to setup guide
   - Added troubleshooting section for WSL Playwright errors

4. **Discovered stuck apt processes**
   - Previous Playwright install attempts left zombie processes
   - These were blocking new apt operations

5. **Created fix script** (`/scripts/fix-playwright-wsl.sh`)
   - Provides manual commands for user to run
   - Bypasses automation issues with sudo in non-terminal environment

6. **Resolved dpkg configuration issues**
   - User ran `sudo dpkg --configure -a` to fix interrupted state
   - Identified Ubuntu 24.04 t64 package naming changes

7. **Successfully installed all dependencies**
   - First wave: Basic browser dependencies with t64 packages
   - Second wave: Additional GTK4, GStreamer, and other libraries
   - All missing libraries resolved

### Session Outcome
âœ… **SUCCESS** - Playwright is now working from WSL console! User confirmed all dependencies are installed and Playwright can run tests.

### Current Status
Session complete. Ready to start new session for red-green TDD implementation phase.
