# WSL Environment Fix Session - Plan Details

## Session Goal
Fix WSL environment to run `make test-tdd` properly without issues

## Context
- ngrok is working as expected in WSL
- Playwright tests were successfully running on Windows
- WSL environment is missing system dependencies for Playwright browsers
- Stuck apt processes are preventing dependency installation

## Plan
1. ✅ Identify the root cause (missing system dependencies for Playwright browsers)
2. ✅ Create scripts to handle WSL-specific Playwright setup
3. ✅ Update Makefile with WSL-specific commands
4. ✅ Update documentation for WSL users
5. ⏳ Help user resolve stuck apt processes
6. ⏳ Ensure Playwright dependencies are properly installed
7. ⏳ Verify `make test-tdd` works correctly

## Technical Details
- Error: "Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers"
- Required packages: libnspr4, libnss3, libatk1.0-0, etc.
- Stuck apt processes preventing installation
- Solution: Manual cleanup and installation of dependencies
