# TDD Test Environment Setup Plan

## Session Goal
Configure a proper environment for e2e and unit tests following TDD approach with mock-based practices instead of IS_TEST env variable approach.

## Key Objectives
1. Design and implement a state-of-the-art industry solution for test environment setup
2. Follow mock-based testing practices
3. Avoid the IS_TEST environment variable anti-pattern
4. Set up both unit and e2e testing frameworks properly

## Plan Steps
1. Review existing best practices documentation
2. Analyze current project structure and testing needs
3. Design mock-based testing architecture
4. Implement unit testing setup
5. Implement e2e testing setup
6. Create example tests demonstrating the approach
7. Document the final solution

## Success Criteria
- Clean separation between test and production code
- No reliance on IS_TEST environment variables
- Proper mocking strategies implemented
- Both unit and e2e tests can run independently
- Clear documentation for team to follow
