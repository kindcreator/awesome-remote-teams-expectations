# Agent Diary - Database Seeding Session
Date: 2025-08-07

## Session Start
- New session for database seeding implementation
- Using Drizzle ORM seeding approach
- Goal: Create reproducible seed data for development/testing

## Progress Log
- Created session tracking files
- Ready to research Drizzle seeding and implement

## Research Findings
- Drizzle Seed package already installed (`drizzle-seed: ^0.3.1`)
- Database configured with PostgreSQL via Supabase
- Schema includes: users (with Clerk integration) and expectations tables

## Current Setup Analysis
- Database connection: `/db/index.ts`
- Schemas: `/db/schema/users.ts` and `/db/schema/expectations.ts`
- Users table has Clerk integration via `clerkUserId`
- Expectations table has proper constraints (one active per user)

## Seed Implementation Plan
1. Create `/db/seed.ts` file for seed script
2. Use `drizzle-seed` package for generating realistic data
3. Create demo users with known Clerk IDs for testing
4. Generate mix of active and completed expectations
5. Add `db:seed` npm script for easy execution
