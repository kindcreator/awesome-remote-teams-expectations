# Agent Diary - E2E Test Fix Session - 2025-08-08

## Session Start
- **Issue**: E2e API tests failing - database seeding stuck in infinite loop
- **Symptom**: Running `make test-api-fresh` hangs at "Pulling schema from database..."
- **Goal**: Fix the test database setup to enable e2e tests to run

## Progress Log

### Entry 1: Initial Analysis
- Created session tracking files
- Observed that the process hangs during `drizzle-kit push` operation
- Need to investigate the test database setup script and configuration

### Entry 2: Root Cause Identified
- Found the issue in `.env.test` file
- DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_DATABASE_URL have swapped ports:
  - DATABASE_URL is using port 5432 (should be pooler port 6543)
  - DIRECT_DATABASE_URL is using port 6543 (should be direct port 5432)
- The setup script expects:
  - DIRECT_DATABASE_URL for schema push (needs direct connection on port 5432)
  - DATABASE_URL for application use (pooler connection on port 6543)
- Current configuration causes drizzle-kit to hang when trying to use pooler for schema operations

### Entry 3: Fix Applied and Testing
- Fixed the `.env.test` file by swapping the ports correctly
- Database setup now completes successfully
- API tests are hanging when trying to start the dev server
- The playwright config is trying to start the server but it's not working properly

### Entry 4: Port Conflict Resolution
- Discovered port 3000 was in use, causing dev server to use port 3001
- Updated both playwright.config.ts and playwright.api.config.ts to use port 3001
- Changed webServer configuration to use 'next dev' directly with port setting

### Entry 5: Success - All Tests Passing
- API tests: All 7 tests passing
- E2E tests: All 15 tests passing
- Database setup working correctly with proper port configuration
- Test environment now fully functional
