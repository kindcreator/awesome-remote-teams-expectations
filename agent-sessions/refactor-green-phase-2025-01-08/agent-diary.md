# Agent Diary - Refactor to GREEN Phase
Date: 2025-01-08

## Session Start
- User asking about Next.js full-stack architecture
- Coming from .NET backend + Next.js frontend background
- Goal: Refactor and reach GREEN phase of TDD

## Initial Analysis
- Project is small, pragmatic approach needed
- Already have service layer pattern in place
- Tests are partially GREEN (API tests passing, E2E failing due to missing UI)

## Architecture Decisions
- Recommended pragmatic layered approach for small Next.js projects
- Use Server Components by default for data fetching
- Only use API routes when needed for client-side interactivity
- Service layer remains reusable between API routes and Server Components

## Implementation Progress
- Created expectations list UI component
- Initially used Server Component approach with direct service calls
- Switched to Client Component with API fetching for better test compatibility
- All E2E tests now passing (15/15)
- API tests passing (7/7)
- Unit tests passing (6/6) with mock warnings

## GREEN Phase Achieved âœ…
- All test suites are now GREEN
- UI component properly displays expectations
- Loading states handled correctly
- Empty states shown when appropriate
- Refresh functionality working
