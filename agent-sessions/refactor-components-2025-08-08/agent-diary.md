# Agent Diary - Component Refactoring Session
Date: 2025-08-08

## Session Overview
Refactoring the codebase to improve component organization and reduce page file complexity.

## Progress Log

### 09:00 - Session Start
- Read initialization protocols from `/docs/protocols/init.md` and `/docs/protocols/start-work.md`
- Reviewed current component structure in `/components/` directory
- Analyzed `/app/page.tsx` (landing page) and `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (dashboard) for refactoring opportunities

### Current State Analysis
1. **Components Directory**: Has UI components from shadcn/ui and some custom components, but lacks logical grouping
2. **Landing Page (`/app/page.tsx`)**: 194 lines, contains inline component definitions and sections
3. **Dashboard Page (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**: 459 lines, very large file with multiple inline components

### Identified Issues
- Large monolithic page components
- Inline component definitions within pages
- No logical grouping of related components
- Missing separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. Create logical component groups in `/components/` directory
2. Extract inline components from pages into separate files
3. Refactor page files to use imported components
4. Improve code organization and maintainability
