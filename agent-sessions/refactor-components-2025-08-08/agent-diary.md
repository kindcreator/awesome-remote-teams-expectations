# Agent Diary - Component Refactoring Session
Date: 2025-08-08

## Session Overview
Refactoring the codebase to improve component organization and reduce page file complexity.

## Progress Log

### 09:00 - Session Start
- Read initialization protocols from `/docs/protocols/init.md` and `/docs/protocols/start-work.md`
- Reviewed current component structure in `/components/` directory
- Analyzed `/app/page.tsx` (landing page) and `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (dashboard) for refactoring opportunities

### Current State Analysis
1. **Components Directory**: Has UI components from shadcn/ui and some custom components, but lacks logical grouping
2. **Landing Page (`/app/page.tsx`)**: 194 lines, contains inline component definitions and sections
3. **Dashboard Page (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**: 459 lines, very large file with multiple inline components

### Identified Issues
- Large monolithic page components
- Inline component definitions within pages
- No logical grouping of related components
- Missing separation of concerns

## Completed Tasks
✅ Created logical component directory structure:
   - `/components/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components
   - `/components/landing/` - Landing page components
   - `/components/layout/` - Shared layout components
   - `/components/shared/` - Reusable components

✅ Extracted 10 components from dashboard page:
   1. SidebarItem
   2. ExpectationCard
   3. EmptyState
   4. DashboardHeader
   5. SidebarNav
   6. MobileMenu
   7. MyExpectationsSection
   8. TeamExpectationsSection
   9. HistorySection
   10. Fixed TypeScript types

✅ Extracted 4 components from landing page:
   1. HeroSection
   2. FeatureCards
   3. DashboardPreview
   4. LandingHeader

✅ Refactored both pages to use extracted components
   - Dashboard page reduced from 459 lines to ~80 lines
   - Landing page reduced from 194 lines to ~35 lines

✅ Added avatar URL environment variable support for demo user
   - Updated `ensure-demo-user.ts` to use `E2E_CLERK_USER_AVATAR_URL`
   - Added environment variable to `.env.test` template

## Results
- Better code organization with logical component grouping
- Improved maintainability with smaller, focused components
- Enhanced reusability across the application
- Cleaner, more readable page files
- All functionality preserved and working
