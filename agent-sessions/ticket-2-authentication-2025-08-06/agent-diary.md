# Agent Diary - Ticket #2: Authentication
Date: 2025-01-05

## Session Start
- Reviewed ticket requirements for authentication implementation
- Must follow strict TDD: test first, then implementation
- Using Clerk for authentication as per requirements
- Need to avoid IS_TEST_MODE anti-pattern

## Current Status
- Project already has Clerk configured (from Ticket #1)
- Testing infrastructure is set up (Playwright, Vitest, MSW)
- Need to check existing tests and create RED tests for authentication features

## Next Steps
1. Check existing test files to understand current coverage
2. Write failing E2E tests for authentication requirements
3. Commit tests (RED state)
4. Implement features to make tests pass
5. Commit implementation (GREEN state)

## Progress Update (01:20 UTC)
- Found existing E2E tests for authentication
- Tests are failing (good for TDD - RED state)
- Some tests already exist but need refinement:
  - Dashboard protection test exists and passes
  - Auth flow test exists but has incorrect assertions
  - API auth test has implementation issues
- Need to create focused tests for Ticket #2 requirements
