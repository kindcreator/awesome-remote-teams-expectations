# Documentation Build Session Plan - 2025-08-04

## Session Goal
Build comprehensive documentation for the awesome-remote-teams-expectations repository following the docsmaster agent principles of empirical truth and canonical documentation.

## Analysis Summary
This is a Next.js 15 application focused on managing remote team expectations. The project uses:
- Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI components for the UI framework
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation

## Documentation Strategy
Following docsmaster principles:
1. Document only what exists in the current codebase
2. Each piece of information has one canonical location
3. Present tense documentation describing the system as it is
4. Maximum clarity with minimum verbosity

## Session Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Initial Documentation Structure
Created documentation following initial understanding, later corrected to match Documentation Maintenance Guide.

### Phase 2: Documentation Restructure
Reorganized documentation to follow proper separation of concerns:
- `/docs/datamodel/` - Data model documentation
- `/docs/frontend/` - Frontend implementation
- `/docs/backend/` - Backend implementation
- `/docs/devops/` - Deployment and operations
- Root `README.md` - Business-focused overview only

### Phase 3: Architecture Design
Following architect agent mindset, created comprehensive system design:
- Data architecture with ER diagrams and schemas
- API architecture with Server Actions and OpenAPI spec
- Security architecture with Clerk auth and RBAC
- Infrastructure blueprint for Hostinger VPS with Coolify
- Service boundaries and communication patterns

### Deployment Platform Clarification
- **Initial assumption**: Vercel deployment
- **Actual setup**: Hostinger VPS with Coolify
- **Repository**: https://github.com/kindcreator/awesome-remote-teams-expectations
- **Proxy**: Traefik (not Nginx)
- **Build**: Nixpacks (not manual Docker)

## Deliverables
1. Complete documentation structure per guidelines
2. Architecture specifications ready for implementation
3. Deployment documentation for Coolify platform
4. Updated docmap files for easy navigation
