# Agent Diary - Documentation Build Session - 2025-08-04

## Session Start
Starting documentation build for awesome-remote-teams-expectations repository.

### Initial Analysis
- Repository is a Next.js 15 application
- Core purpose: Managing remote team expectations
- Existing docs structure is minimal with only agent and protocol documentation
- No technical documentation exists for the actual application

### Key Findings
1. The application appears to be a team expectations management system
2. Has features for viewing, managing, and tracking history of expectations
3. Uses modern React patterns with TypeScript
4. Comprehensive UI component library based on Radix UI

### Next Steps
Will analyze git history and codebase to build empirical documentation based on current state.

## Session Progress

### Documentation Created
Following the docsmaster principles of empirical truth and canonical documentation:

1. **Root Documentation** (`/docs/README.md`)
   - Project overview and quick start guide
   - Technology stack summary
   - Documentation structure guide

2. **API Documentation** (`/docs/api/`)
   - `types.md`: Core TypeScript type definitions
   - `data-models.md`: Data flow and state management patterns

3. **Feature Documentation** (`/docs/features/`)
   - `team-expectations.md`: Core expectation management feature
   - `history-tracking.md`: Historical view and metrics

4. **Architecture Documentation** (`/docs/architecture/`)
   - `overview.md`: System architecture and design decisions
   - `tech-stack.md`: Comprehensive technology choices

5. **Component Documentation** (`/docs/components/`)
   - `ui-components.md`: Radix UI component library reference
   - `custom-components.md`: Business-specific components

### Documentation Principles Applied
- Only documented what exists in the current codebase
- Each piece of information has one canonical location
- Used present tense throughout
- Focused on technical accuracy over narrative

## Session Complete
All planned documentation has been created based on the current state of the codebase.

## Session Restructure

### Requirement Change
User identified that documentation structure did not follow the Documentation Maintenance Guide. Need to restructure following the proper pattern with separation of concerns.

### New Structure Created
Following the Documentation Maintenance Guide:

1. **Root README.md** - Business-focused overview only
2. **Docmap Files**:
   - `/docs/datamodel/docmap.md` - Data model references
   - `/docs/frontend/docmap.md` - Frontend implementation
   - `/docs/backend/docmap.md` - Backend implementation
   - `/docs/devops/` - Deployment documentation

3. **Section Documentation**:
   - `/docs/datamodel/entities.md` - Core data models
   - `/docs/frontend/pages.md` - Page documentation
   - `/docs/frontend/components.md` - Component reference
   - `/docs/backend/api.md` - API documentation
   - `/docs/devops/deployment.md` - Deployment guide

### Key Insights from 42cc PDF
The PDF revealed this is a test assignment with specific requirements:
- Full authentication with Clerk
- Database persistence with Supabase
- Drizzle ORM for data access
- TDD approach for backend
- Specific ticket-based implementation

Current implementation is a simplified prototype without these features.

## Final Status
Documentation restructured to follow guide requirements while accurately reflecting current implementation state.
