# Agent Session Diary - Clerk Auth Sync - 2025-08-05

## Session Start
- Initialized session for Clerk authentication sync implementation
- Created session tracking files
- Reviewed project documentation structure

## Key Requirements
- Clerk already integrated for user registration
- Need to sync Clerk users with backend (Supabase + Drizzle ORM)
- Only authenticated users should access dashboard

## Analysis Complete
- Reviewed backend security architecture
- Users table has clerkUserId field (unique constraint)
- Need webhook endpoint to sync Clerk user creation/updates
- Need authentication middleware for dashboard protection

## Implementation Plan (TDD)
1. Set up Vitest testing infrastructure
2. Write tests for Clerk webhook endpoint
3. Implement webhook endpoint
4. Write tests for auth middleware
5. Implement auth middleware

## Issue Found
- No testing infrastructure configured in the project
- Need to set up Vitest before writing tests

## Updated Approach
- Using Playwright for all testing (E2E and API)
- Following TDD guide recommendations for Playwright + Next.js

## Tests Written (Red Phase)
1. Created playwright.config.ts with minimal configuration
2. Written failing tests for Clerk webhook endpoint:
   - User creation sync
   - User update sync
   - Invalid signature handling
   - Missing fields handling
   - Unhandled event types
3. Written failing tests for authentication flow:
   - Unauthenticated redirect
   - Authenticated dashboard access
   - User data sync on first sign-in
   - Sign-out flow
   - API route protection

## Next Steps
- Install Playwright: `npm init playwright@latest`
- Run tests to confirm they fail
- Implement webhook endpoint
- Implement authentication middleware

## Testing Automation Created
1. Enhanced Makefile with comprehensive testing commands:
   - TDD workflow: `make test-tdd FILE=path/to/test.spec.ts`
   - Fast feedback: `make test-fast`
   - CI testing: `make test-ci`
   - Test types: `make test-api`, `make test-e2e`
   - Debugging: `make test-debug`, `make test-headed`
2. Added npm scripts for common test commands
3. Created testing documentation at `/docs/testing/playwright-guide.md`

## Recommended Workflow
1. Install Playwright dependency: `make playwright-setup`
2. Install browsers: `make playwright-install`
3. TDD: `make test-tdd FILE=tests/api/clerk-webhook.spec.ts`
4. Fast feedback: `make test-fast`
5. Full validation: `make validate`

## Issues Fixed
- Removed non-existent --watch flag from Playwright commands
- Added playwright-setup command to install @playwright/test dependency first
- Updated documentation to reflect correct setup steps

## Implementation Completed (Green Phase)
1. Created Clerk webhook endpoint at `/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`:
   - Handles user.created and user.updated events
   - Verifies webhook signatures with Svix
   - Syncs user data to database
2. Updated middleware.ts to protect dashboard and user API routes
3. Created user profile API endpoint at `/app/api/user/profile/route.ts`
4. Updated dashboard page to include:
   - Clerk authentication integration
   - UserButton component
   - Test IDs for E2E testing
5. Created setup documentation at `/docs/setup/clerk-webhook-setup.md`

## Remaining Tasks
1. Install svix package: `npm install svix --legacy-peer-deps` âœ… (Done)
2. Configure CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env.local
3. Set up webhook in Clerk Dashboard
4. Run tests to verify everything works

## Documentation Updates Completed
1. Created comprehensive setup guide at `/docs/setup/complete-setup-guide.md`
2. Updated README.md with quick start instructions
3. Removed redundant documentation files
4. Created quick setup script for new developers
5. Updated Makefile with streamlined commands

## Improved Setup Flow
- New developers can now run `make setup` for guided setup
- ngrok configuration reads from `.env.local` for reusability
- All credentials centralized in `.env.local`
- Consolidated documentation for easier reference

## Key Commands
- `make setup` - Quick setup for new developers
- `make dev` - Start development server
- `make dev-tunnel` - Start ngrok tunnel (uses token from .env.local)
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make help` - Show all available commands
