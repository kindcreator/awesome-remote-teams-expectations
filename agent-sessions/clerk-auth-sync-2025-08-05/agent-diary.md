## Analysis Complete
- Reviewed backend security architecture
- Users table has clerkUserId field (unique constraint)
- Need webhook endpoint to sync Clerk user creation/updates

## Implementation Plan (TDD)
1. Set up Vitest testing infrastructure
2. Write tests for Clerk webhook endpoint
3. Implement webhook endpoint
4. Write tests for auth middleware
5. Implement auth middleware

## Issue Found
- No testing infrastructure configured in the project
