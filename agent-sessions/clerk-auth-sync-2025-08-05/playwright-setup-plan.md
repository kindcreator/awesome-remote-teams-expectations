# Playwright Testing Setup Plan

## Why Playwright?
- Industry-standard E2E testing tool
- Excellent for API testing via request context
- Strong TypeScript support
- Can test authentication flows effectively
- Works well with Next.js and Clerk

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Install Playwright
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

### 2. Additional Dependencies for API Testing
```bash
npm install -D @types/node dotenv
```

### 3. Configuration Structure
- `playwright.config.ts` - Main configuration
- `tests/` - Test files directory
  - `api/` - API endpoint tests
  - `e2e/` - End-to-end tests
  - `fixtures/` - Shared test fixtures

## Testing Approach

### API Testing (Webhook)
```typescript
// tests/api/clerk-webhook.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Clerk Webhook', () => {
  test('should create user on user.created event', async ({ request }) => {
    // Test webhook endpoint
  });
});
```

### E2E Testing (Auth Flow)
```typescript
// tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Authentication', () => {
  test('should protect dashboard for unauthenticated users', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test dashboard protection
  });
});
```

## Next Steps
1. Set up Playwright configuration
2. Create test structure
3. Write API tests for Clerk webhook
4. Write E2E tests for authentication flow
