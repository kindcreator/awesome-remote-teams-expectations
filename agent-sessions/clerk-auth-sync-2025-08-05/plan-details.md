# Clerk Authentication Sync Implementation Plan

## Session Goal
Implement synchronization between Clerk authentication and our backend (Supabase + Drizzle ORM) to ensure authenticated users can access the dashboard.

## Current State
- Clerk is already integrated for user registration with identity providers
- Database has users table with clerk_user_id field
- Need to create sync mechanism between Clerk and our backend

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Analyze Current Authentication Setup
- Review existing Clerk integration
- Understand current user flow
- Identify sync points between Clerk and backend

### 2. Implement User Sync Mechanism
- Create webhook endpoint for Clerk user events
- Implement user creation/update in database when Clerk user is created/updated
- Ensure clerk_user_id is properly mapped

### 3. Implement Authentication Middleware
- Create middleware to verify Clerk session
- Ensure authenticated users can access dashboard
- Protect dashboard routes

### 4. Testing
- Test user registration flow
- Test authentication flow
- Verify database sync

## Technical Approach
- Follow TDD principles as per agent guidelines
- Use existing Drizzle ORM setup
- Leverage Clerk's Next.js integration
