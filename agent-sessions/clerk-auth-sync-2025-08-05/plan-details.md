# Clerk Authentication Sync Implementation Plan

## Session Goal
Implement synchronization between Clerk authentication and our backend (Supabase + Drizzle ORM) to ensure authenticated users can access the dashboard.

## Current State
- Clerk is already integrated for user registration with identity providers
- Database has users table with clerk_user_id field
- Need to create sync mechanism between Clerk and our backend

## Implementation Plan (TDD Approach)

### 1. Analyze Current Setup
- Review backend documentation
- Analyze database schema
- Understand existing auth flow

### 2. Test & Implement Clerk Webhook (TDD)
- **First commit**: Write tests for Clerk webhook endpoint
  - Test user creation sync
  - Test user update sync
  - Test error handling
- **Second commit**: Implement webhook endpoint

### 3. Test & Implement Authentication Middleware (TDD)
- **First commit**: Write tests for auth middleware
  - Test authenticated access
  - Test unauthenticated rejection
  - Test session validation
- **Second commit**: Implement middleware

### 4. Integration Testing
- **First commit**: Write integration tests for full auth flow
- **Second commit**: Fix any issues found

## Technical Approach
- Follow TDD principles - test first, then implement
- Use Playwright for E2E and API testing
- Use existing Drizzle ORM setup
- Leverage Clerk's webhook system for user sync

## Testing Strategy with Playwright
- API Testing: Use Playwright's request context for testing webhook endpoints
- E2E Testing: Test full authentication flows including login, dashboard access
- Component Testing: Playwright experimental component testing for isolated UI tests
