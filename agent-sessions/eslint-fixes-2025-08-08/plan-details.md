# ESLint Fixes Session - 2025-08-08

## Goal
Fix all ESLint warnings in the codebase

## Issues to Fix
1. `/app/dashboard/page.tsx:24:5` - 'othersExpectations' is assigned but never used
2. `/app/dashboard/page.tsx:32:9` - 'completedExpectations' is assigned but never used  
3. `/components/animated-text.tsx:17:9` - 'letters' is assigned but never used

## Approach
- Remove unused variables that are not needed
- Keep variables that might be used for future features but prefix with underscore if ESLint allows
- Ensure no functionality is broken by removing these variables
