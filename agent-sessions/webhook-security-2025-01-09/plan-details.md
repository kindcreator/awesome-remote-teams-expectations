# Webhook Security Implementation - Green Phase
Date: 2025-01-09

## Goal
Implement proper webhook secret validation to pass the failing tests and ensure security.

## Key Requirements
1. Validate WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable exists before processing
2. Return 500 error with clear logging if secret is missing
3. Prevent accepting forged requests by failing fast

## Implementation Steps
1. Check for WEBHOOK_SECRET env var at the start of webhook handler
2. Return early with 500 status if missing
3. Add clear error logging for debugging
4. Only construct Webhook instance after validation

## Test Coverage
- Webhook secret validation
- Proper error handling for missing secret
- Security against forged requests
