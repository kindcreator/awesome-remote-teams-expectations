# Agent Diary - Webhook Security Implementation
Date: 2025-01-09

## Session Start
- Initialized session for implementing webhook security green phase
- Read project documentation and 42cc requirements
- Focus: Fail fast if webhook secret is missing to prevent security vulnerabilities

## Progress Log
- Created session tracking files
- Examined current webhook implementation at `/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`
- Found security vulnerability: webhook was using empty string fallback for missing secret
- Implemented fix: Added validation at the start of POST handler to check for CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- Returns 500 error with clear logging if secret is missing
- Prevents accepting forged requests by failing fast before Webhook instance creation

## Green Phase Implementation
- Fixed date validation issues in tests (using future dates instead of past dates)
- Refactored test mocks to use service layer instead of direct database mocking
- Fixed authorization checks to ensure users can only modify/delete their own expectations
- Added proper state management in integration test mocks
- Implemented proper user authorization in all CRUD operations
- All server action tests passing (24/24)
- All integration tests passing (8/8)

## Summary
Successfully implemented:
1. Webhook secret validation - fails fast with 500 if CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET is missing
2. Proper error logging for security issues
3. Fixed all test date validation issues
4. Ensured proper user authorization for all CRUD operations
5. Users can only modify/delete their own expectations
6. Created date helper utilities for cleaner test code:
   - `daysFromNow(days)` - creates future dates
   - `hoursFromNow(hours)` - creates future dates with hours
   - `daysAgo(days)` - creates past dates
7. Refactored all test files to use the new date helpers for better readability
