# Agent Diary - Webhook Security Implementation
Date: 2025-01-09

## Session Start
- Initialized session for implementing webhook security green phase
- Read project documentation and 42cc requirements
- Focus: Fail fast if webhook secret is missing to prevent security vulnerabilities

## Progress Log
- Created session tracking files
- Examined current webhook implementation at `/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`
- Found security vulnerability: webhook was using empty string fallback for missing secret
- Implemented fix: Added validation at the start of POST handler to check for CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- Returns 500 error with clear logging if secret is missing
- Prevents accepting forged requests by failing fast before Webhook instance creation

## Green Phase Implementation
- Fixed date validation issues in tests (using future dates instead of past dates)
- Refactored test mocks to use service layer instead of direct database mocking
- Fixed authorization checks to ensure users can only modify/delete their own expectations
- Added proper state management in integration test mocks
- Implemented proper user authorization in all CRUD operations
- All server action tests passing (24/24)
- Integration tests almost complete (7/8 passing)
