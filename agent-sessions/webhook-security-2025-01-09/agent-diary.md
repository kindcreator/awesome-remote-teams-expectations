# Agent Diary - Webhook Security Implementation
Date: 2025-01-09

## Session Start
- Initialized session for implementing webhook security green phase
- Read project documentation and 42cc requirements
- Focus: Fail fast if webhook secret is missing to prevent security vulnerabilities

## Progress Log
- Created session tracking files
- Examined current webhook implementation at `/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`
- Found security vulnerability: webhook was using empty string fallback for missing secret
- Implemented fix: Added validation at the start of POST handler to check for CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- Returns 500 error with clear logging if secret is missing
- Prevents accepting forged requests by failing fast before Webhook instance creation
