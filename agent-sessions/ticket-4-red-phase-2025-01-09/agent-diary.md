# Agent Diary - Ticket #4 Red Phase
Date: 2025-01-09

## Session Start
- Starting TDD Red phase for Ticket #4: Add & Modify My Expectation
- Focus: Writing comprehensive tests before implementation
- Following TDD principles: First commit will be tests only

## Progress Log
- Created session tracking files
- Reviewing existing codebase structure to understand testing setup
- Found existing ExpectationsService with getAllActive, getAll, getByUserId, getById methods
- Database schema shows unique constraint for one active expectation per user
- No server actions exist yet - need to write tests for new server actions
- Will create tests for: addExpectation, updateExpectation, deleteExpectation, markAsDone

## Tests Created
1. **Server Action Tests** (`app/actions/expectations.test.ts`)
   - addExpectation: Tests for creating new expectations with validation
   - updateExpectation: Tests for editing existing expectations
   - deleteExpectation: Tests for removing expectations
   - markExpectationAsDone: Tests for completing expectations
   - getUserActiveExpectation: Tests for fetching current active expectation
   - All tests include auth validation, input validation, and authorization checks

2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/expectations-flow.test.ts`)
   - Complete user flow from creation to completion
   - One active expectation per user rule enforcement
   - Deletion flow testing
   - Error handling for various scenarios
   - Business rules validation
   - Concurrent operations handling

## Key Test Coverage
- Authentication requirements for all actions
- Input validation (title length, date validation)
- Authorization (users can only modify their own expectations)
- Database constraint enforcement (one active per user)
- State transitions (cannot edit completed expectations)
- Error handling and edge cases
